sage-config
===========

My SAGEmath configuration, in which I introduce the object `S` and all of it's superpowers. For more info, please consult [the wiki](https://github.com/PythonNut/sage-config/wiki).

I's a horrible mess, written mostly in a hurry without regard for convention a long time ago. However, I personally find it incredibly useful for my day-to-day calculations.

Installation
============
```bash
cd ~/.sage
git init
git remote add origin http://github.com/PythonNut/sage-config
git fetch -a
git checkout -t origin/master
```
